# Optional
# --------------------------------------
CSS countdown timer or something? Do that interval timeout thing

add inheritance to the objects so I can have gamearea, x, y on everything?
	then label with text
		then timer with overridden update method
	same with player/elf I think

add a pause button?

consider letting them choose parameters:
	# of elves
	speed of them
	speed of you
	add/take away from color options (keep it random)
