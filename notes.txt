use current settings with 10 elves for "hard mode"?
	make it faster with 10 elves for "insane"

CSS countdown timer or something? Do that interval timeout thing

change name of this project, take old multiplayer notes and move them to the actual multiplayer project


# Optional
# --------------------------------------

add inheritance to the objects so I can have gamearea, x, y on everything?
	then label with text
		then timer with overridden update method
	same with player/elf I think

add a pause button?

consider letting them choose parameters:
	# of elves
	speed of them
	speed of you
	add/take away from color options (keep it random)

# =============================================================================


1. When you open a page, you get a circle as an avatar. When you click somewhere in the designated area, the avatar goes there.
	Get this syncing for multiple users via MongoDB

2. Get it working for WASD keylisteners

3. Let them hit spacebar within a certain radius, and it makes the other player turn red
	Make the redness go away shortly to indicate "dmg taken"

4. Make "attacks" subtract from a health bar green-red, down to 0

5. After 0 health, the circle disappears for all active users, dead user is presented with a respawn button
